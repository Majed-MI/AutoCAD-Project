# AutoCAD-Project
This project is done by a group of 10 members from EEE'18 batch. The Project was to make a floor plan with an electrical outlook in it. 
It was actually done as a part of our 2-2 sessional course. We have also estimated the total costing of the electrical layout with approximate labor costing.
